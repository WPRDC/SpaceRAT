name: Local Total Assessed Value
description: The assessed property value (land and building together) for local tax purposes (for schools and municipalities). This amount reflects the remaining assessment after preferential assessments (such as clean & green) have been deducted from the base year market values. This value is often higher than the county assessed value since county-only incentives (such as homesteads) have not been deducted.
